# Flight Management System - Project Phase 4

## Overview
This project is the final phase of the CS4.301 - Data and Applications course (Monsoon '23). The objective is to implement a Flight Management System using MySQL for database creation and Python3 for building a command line interface. The project involves creating the database based on previously modeled relational schemas and implementing functional requirements through SQL queries and a Python script.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Creating the Database:**
   - Utilize MySQL CLI to create the database according to the relational model from Phase 3.
   - Account for all constraints (entity, referential, domain, etc.) while creating the database.
   - Load tables with legitimate values; each table should contain at least 5 tuples.

2. **Performing Queries on the Database:**
   - Implement functional requirements mentioned in the Phase 1 submission.
   - Include at least 2 queries for each kind of operation (insertion, update, selection, projection, etc.) for both modifications and retrievals.
   - Include at least 2 analysis queries involving the JOIN clause from Phase 1.
